                In the event that the assets or stock of the Operators, their corporate licensees or parent company(s) are sold or transferred, merged with a different company or entity, restructured, or subject to other fundamental corporate changes, we reserve the right to disclose any and all databases compiled from Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Operators to such successor. We will seek to obligate the Operators' successor to agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy, as it may hereafter be modified, but cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so or that the successor company will comply with this obligation.
            </p>

            <p>
                We reserve the right to collect Personal Information using any new technology yet to be developed and to use such technology to provide new services and features to you, as well as for marketing and promotional purposes. Specific information regarding your choice to Opt-in or to Opt-out to such use, or for sharing your Personal Information with Advertisers, will be provided once the new technology, service, or feature is introduced.

                WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
            </p>

            <p>
                Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our Site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their first and last name, mailing address, phone number, and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or gender).  We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about the rewards service, and to notify and ship prizes to the winners of auctions, sweepstakes, or contests as well as mail checks for cash earned on purchases made through the rewards service.  The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary.  We give users the option to remove their information from our database, to not receive future communications, or to no longer receive our service, by submitting your request to Member Support.  Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unless stated otherwise, we do not request contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as ".net" or ".com") as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent.  We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number  that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial email. We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial email and therefore, are not regulated by Federal law.  <strong>However, when "computer to phone" commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your wireless device contact information when such information is submitted for certain Site features or services. We will attempt to notify you if we will need new contact information.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                For specific purposes (such as the purchase of goods and services) we may request a type of confidential personally identifiable information which shall be called "Sensitive Personal Information" and is defined as any individual's: (1) social security number; (2) driver's license number or state identification card number; or (3) account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. This Sensitive Personal Information will only be used to implement the specific activity or event it was submitted for. We will not share your Sensitive Personal Information with Advertisers.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, more general Personal Information will be used to implement the specific activity or event and will also be used for the marketing of additional events, services and merchandising for this Site and the Operators.
            </p>

            <p>
                EMAIL
            </p>

            <p>If you sign up for an email newsletter or alert, we will use your email address to deliver the newsletter or alert requested. To opt-out of any  newsletter or alert, click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email or alert you received or go to Subscriptions and uncheck the box or boxes for the newsletters or alerts you wish to opt-out of.

                DISCLOSURE TO ADVERTISERS
            </p>

            <p>
                Advertising support allows us to offer, free of charge, many great activities and services to our users such as contests, sweepstakes and special events. Therefore, we may also use your Personal Information for the marketing of events, products or services of our generous Advertisers. There are two ways users may receive such information from Advertisers, either indirectly via newsletters, email or direct mail from the Site, or directly from the Advertiser. We may use one or both methods depending on the activity and the Advertiser.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our opt-in program allows you the opportunity to request to be contacted with additional information, to receive special offers and/or to receive materials from Advertisers. If you elect to opt-in to receive information, materials or special offers from these third parties, you give the Operators permission to transfer your personal information to our partners so they can fulfill your request. We will only share your information with those Advertisers or category of Advertisers you specifically opt-in to. Our third party partners have separate privacy and data collection practices; the Operators have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you do not want your personal information shared with Advertisers, please select the option to not participate in our opt-in program.
            </p>

            <p>
                You have the option of completing online surveys as a part of the rewards service. Among other things, our surveys ask for demographic information (like income level). The information collected through these surveys is used to tailor our visitors' experience at our site and may be shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our Site also provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our Advertisers at the point where we request information about the visitor.
            </p>

            <p>
                We give users the option to remove their information from our database, to not receive future communications, or to no longer receive our service, by submitting your request to Member Support.
            </p>

            <p>
                SECURITY MEASURES
            </p>

            <p>
                We conduct the collection, management, maintenance and storage of website user information in a secure and commercially reasonable manner using acceptable industry standards of security technology and practices (such as electronic security systems and password protections) to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Information. We also request that our operational service providers take such precautions. The Operator databases are accessible only by authorized personnel.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, please note that when users transmit Personal Information over an unsecured Internet connection, the Site is not responsible for the security of that information during the transmission stage as your email or registration could be copied or intercepted by unknown third parties. We use a secured connection only for the collection of Sensitive Personal Information, which is necessary for the purchase of goods or services, but we do not use a secured connection for other types of activities. Therefore, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you transmit certain Personal Information over this Site at your own risk.

                CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY
            </p>

            <p>
                Although persons of all ages may visit our Site and participate in activities that do not require the collection of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information from children under the age of 13. Except for the limited circumstances listed below, we will automatically reject and delete the registration or entry of any person we believe in good faith to be underage. Any false or fraudulent registration or entry from a minor will be deemed to be ineligible and will disqualify the minor from the receipt of a prize, benefit, or other participation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Except to meet Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), or other regulatory and legal purposes, we will not use, store, or disclose any child's Personal Information to a third party without prior parental consent.
            </p>

            <p>
                This Site may have contests and prizes that could appeal to children. However, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect personal Information from children. If we unintentionally receive Personal Information from children under the age of 13 in relation to this activity, we will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") and reject and destroy such correspondence upon knowledge of such collection, except for the  limited circumstances above. For more information about COPPA, please see the Federal Trade Commission's website: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">www.ftc.gov</a>.

                Your California Privacy Rights
            </p>

            <p>
                Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Operators of Atlanta's Rock Rewards qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). You may contact us in two ways. Send email to Privacy Administrator at<strong> the email address listed in the Contact Us section below. Alternatively, you may contact the Operators at the physical address listed below in the Contact Us section of this privacy statement.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong> For requests sent via email, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of your email. All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request. </strong> For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a  response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.) <strong><u>We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile.</u></strong> We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
            </p>

            <p>
                To all other users of this Site, if you have other questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Administrator at the email address or physical address listed below in the Contact Us section of this privacy statement.
            </p>

            <p>

This Site is designed and targeted to United States (U.S.) audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the United States. We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or governed by other nations. By your participation in our Site activities, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age and located in the U.S. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate in activities on this Site contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. Please be aware that any Personal Information you transfer to us will be transferred to the U.S and subject to U.S. law. By using this Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to this transfer of Personal Information to the U.S., and waive any claims that may arise under your own national laws. All users of the Site are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your continued participation on this Site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.

This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site or a participant in Operators activities. <strong> We reserve the right to revise this policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. Therefore, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy often. </strong>

                Cookies/Image Tags
            </p>

            <p>
                The use of cookies is an industry standard and they are currently used on most websites, including this Site. Cookies are a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of a user's computer so that the website administrator or a third party operational service provider may identify the computer and passively track the user's activities on the website. Image tags work in conjunction with cookies and are small image files that may be located on select pages of our Site, or with-in web-based email newsletters that we may send. (Image tags are also called web beacons, web bugs, clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs.) Tracking is important because we can better understand what parts of our website are used the most, when to launch new services and how to enhance current offerings. We may share the information we receive from cookies and image tags with third-parties and our Advertisers in aggregate form, which means that such information does not contain specific Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information about any one visitor.
            </p>

            <p>
                In short, cookies and image tags collect a user's Internet protocols and server information. Such data files allow our Site to remember your web browser when you visit our Site and are necessary tools for quick and efficient access to the Site. A cookie will not allow the Site to learn any Personal Information (such as your real name and email address) or Sensitive Personal Information that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies and image tags allow the Site to remember important information that will make the Site easier for you to use and helpful in our administration of various activities. We do not use cookies or image tags to collect other Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information unless you give us permission to do so.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent, or efficient and enjoyable - like the features mentioned above - and some of our other services will not function properly.

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy does not cover third party advertising or third party content that may be present on the Site. This Site may provide banner and general advertising, in addition to other content provided by our Advertisers or operational service providers. Users may from time to time purchase goods or services offered through, or otherwise participate in or send messages concerning such advertising, promotions or third party content offered through the Site. Such correspondence, transactions and agreements are solely between the user and the Advertiser or the third party content provider and do not involve the Site. Also, Advertisers and such third party content providers may not have the same privacy policies that we do and you are encouraged to read their privacy policy first.

                HYPER LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

            <p>
                This Site often provides links to third party websites that could be of interest to our users, including the websites of our Advertisers. The Operators do not own or control these websites and therefore, are not responsible for the content, business practices, nor operations of such websites. Third party websites linked on this Site may have different privacy policies and business practices than we do. The presence of a link to a third party website does not constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the third party content, goods, or services available through, or contained on, the Site.
